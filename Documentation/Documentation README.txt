I. Introduction

The documentation provided in this folder is the complete project documentation 
for FlorML and the method for semi-automated mark-up using Perl scripts, as it 
was in use up to March 2016. The documentation was originally in Microsoft Word 
format; some traces of this are still present. It was written with normal users 
in mind, not developers.
